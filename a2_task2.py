# Task 2 code template for FIT9136 Assignment 2.
# Instructions to students:
# 1. Where required, replace the *pass* statements with your own method and
#   function definitions. Your submission must comply with the specification:
#   do not rename specified functions or change the number or type of arguments
#   or return values; otherwise you will be deemed not to have demonstrated
#   clear comprehension of the specified instructions. (You may define
#   your own additional functions and instance variables if you wish, as long
#   as these don't contradict the specified requirements. You may also
#   import any libraries allowed by the assignment specification.)
# 2. Complete task 2 within the framework of this template file.
# 3. Modify the filename (and import statement(s) where required) to replace
#   the xxxxxxxx with your student ID number.
# 4. Complete tasks 1 and 3 within the other template files. The finished
#   program is split into three files, linked together by import statements.
# 5. In this file, you may define your own testing code within the main block
#   to check if your simulation is working when running this script file
#   directly. Code in the main block will not be run by the automarker algorithm,
#   which will instead test the specified functions/methods by attempting to
#   call them directly according to how they are defined in the assignment 
#   requirments specification.
# 6. Before submission, you should remove these instructions from this
#   template file and add your own program comments instead. This template file
#   has omitted program comments, which are your responsibility to add. Any
#   other 'placeholder' comments should be removed from your final submission.
